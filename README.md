# React.js expenses app
This is just a result of an exercise I was doing when learning React.js. Super simple (and probably incorrect) structure.

## Requirements to run this
- Node.js installed on your machine
- React.js
- Tailwindcss

## Demo
- Pull the repo and run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
